\begin{abstract}
Using a thin lens magnetic spectrometer, we measure the momentum spectrum of electrons emitted as $\beta^{-}$ particles from a radioactive source of  \textsuperscript{137}Cs. 
The momentum of the radiated electrons is defined by the adjustable magnetic lens current and $k$ a proportionality constant. The spectrometer's lens current modulates the magnetic field which has the effect of modifying the trajectories of the electrons, focusing electrons with specific momenta onto the detector allowing us to measure their intensity. By converting the measured momentum to energy we are able to fit our data to a linear model based on the Fermi-Kurie plot. We find the value of the kinetic energy of the observed nuclear transition is $T = 0.559 \pm 0.024$ MeV.

% the effect of the magnetic field being to cause a cone of electron trajectories diverging from the source to spiral around the axis of the instrument and become a cone converging on to the detector


% The constant $k$ is determined by calibrating the observed spectrum to the well-known K-conversion peak with kinetic energy $T = 624.21$ keV.


% [9] The use of coordinates of momentum instead of energy in β-ray spectroscopy is partly due to the simple fact that it is the momentum of the focused electrons that is proportional to the magnetic field of the spectrometer or (approximately, if iron is used) to the exciting electric current, and not the energy.

% [9] Suppose that we investigate a distribution of electrons in a magnetic spectrometer,
% the momentum distribution being N(p)dp. ... In a magnetic spectrometer with fixed geometry and variable B the quantity R = ∆(Bρ)/Bρ is constant, where ∆(Bρ) is a measure of the accepted momentum band. When plotting the momentum distribution it is therefore necessary to divide the number of counts P at each magnetic field setting by the corresponding field in order to get the correct form of the spectrum
