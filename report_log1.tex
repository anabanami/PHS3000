We measure the momentum spectrum of electrons emmitted as $\beta-$ radiation from a Cs-137 source. 

Various electron momenta are observed using a magnetic lens spectrometer.
We focus the electron beam by adjusting the magnetic field. 

 The momentum is defined by a proportionality relation between the adjustable lens current and a constant $(k)$ directly dependent of the geometry of the spectrometer.

 k is measured by calibrating the observed spectrum to the well-known K-conversion peak visible in the spectrum. 

 Using a linear model of the Kurie distibution, the relativistic energy-momentum relation and after correcting for the spectrometer resolution $(~2-3\%)$ we find the value of the kinetic energy of the observed nuclear transition is $T = 0.559 \pm 0.024$ MeV. We compare this result to the theoretical value for the transition energy $T_{theory} = 0.512$ MeV  ...
