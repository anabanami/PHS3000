3.Calculate  the  anticipated  range  for  alpha  particles  passing  through  a  thick  gold sample. Assuming  the  energy difference  between  your  measurement  of  the  source’s  alpha  particle  energy and the expected value is due to absorption by the gold coating on the source, determine the thickness of the coating and compare this to the source manufacturer’s value.

6.To  determine  the  effect  of  range  straggling,  you  will  need  to  determine  how  the  number  of  surviving particles varies with pressure. 

Produce a plot of the number of surviving particles as a  function  of pressure.  

Remember  to  consider  the  effects  of  not  observing  below-threshold energy particles.

7.Determine the straggling parameter α from your plot of particle number versus pressure.  (Hint: fit equation 12b to your data using a non-linear fitting tool such as Python or MATLAB. See the documentation in the PHS3000 laboratory manual for more information.) Does your value agree with theoretical predictions? Explain any discrepancy.

8.Also from  your  fit,  obtain  a  value for  the  pressure  corresponding  to  the  range  condition. Compare  this  to  the  value  you  obtained  previously  and  comment  on  any  difference.  Which  result do you think is more accurate and why?
